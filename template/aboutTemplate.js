		'Hi! I am in my final year at Columbia University studying Computer Science & Operations Research in the engineering school. I develop websites, I build apps, and I tune deep neural networks.',
		'I am advised by several leading professors in AI: {Shipra Agrawal}, {Hod Lipson}, {Shuran Song}, and {Peter Allen}.',
		'In my freetime, I teach robots how to learn, I make buckets from three, and I dominate Settlers of Catan.'
	],
	'Research Goals' : 'I aim to leverage reinforcement learning to solve the challenges of real life that cannot be simulated. With a focus on the theory of optimization in sequentialdecision-making, I hope to extend online algorithms to learn from real-world interaction and generalize to all situations, including those that cannot be predetermined',
	'Research Topics': ['Reinforcement Learning',  'Discrete Optimization',  'Robotics',  'Computer Vision'],
