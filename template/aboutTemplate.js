		'Hi! I am studying {Computer Science & Operations Research link=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/ class=emphasis-color inline-text} in the engineering school at Columbia University. I train neural networks, I tune hyperparameters, and I teach agents to make intelligent decisions. {I am looking to join a research lab as a PhD student to advance both the theory and application of reinforcement learning. class=white-emphasis inline-text}',
		'My primary research advisor is {Shipra Agrawal link=http://www.columbia.edu/~sa3305/ class=emphasis-color inline-text}. I have also worked with {Hod Lipson link=//hodlipson.com/ class=emphasis-color inline-text}, {Shuran Song link=//cs.columbia.edu/~shurans/ class=emphasis-color inline-text}, and {Peter Allen link=//cs.columbia.edu/~allen/ class=emphasis-color inline-text}.',

	'Research Goals' : 'I aim to leverage reinforcement learning to solve the challenges of real life that cannot be simulated. With a focus on the theory of optimization in sequential decision-making, I hope to extend online algorithms to learn from real-world interaction and generalize to all situations, including those that cannot be predetermined',
